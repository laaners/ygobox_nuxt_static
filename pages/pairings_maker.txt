Make pairings of 2 people based on how much points they've gathered (a player with more points should be paired with another player with more or less the same points) for match

Richard	3
Edoardo	0
Fede	1
Curry	1
Luiso	0
Giorgio	3
Alessio 0
Riccardo 3

Also the following pairings already happened

Richard vs Edoardo
Fede vs Curry
Luiso vs Giorgio

Also put them in a json like this:

[
    {
        "player1": "p1",
        "player2": "p2",
        "when": "",
        "outcome": ""
    },
]

Also show me the pairings like this:
